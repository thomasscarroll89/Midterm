Description: Conduct Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) on a user-supplied dataset.
    Runs multiple linear (OLS) regressions for every possible combination of
    user-supplied predictor variables, then returns the estimated coefficients
    and R^2 values from each of these models, along with the posterior model
    odds, posterior expected values, and posterior probabilities after
    performing Bayesian Model Averaging.
